# Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, a CSV dataset, and an image resource. The project appears to focus on analyzing crime data, possibly visualizing trends or performing statistical analysis.

## File Structure

1. **la_skyline.jpg**  
   - An image of the Los Angeles skyline.

2. **notebook.ipynb**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook containing the core code and analysis.

3. **crimes.csv**  
   - A CSV file containing crime data. This dataset serves as the primary data source for analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the notebook and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy

You can install required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `notebook.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface and run the cells step by step.

### Data Source
- The `crimes.csv` file contains raw data for analysis. The specific structure of the data will be described within the notebook.

## Usage
This project can be used for:
- Analyzing crime patterns or trends.
- Practicing data analysis and visualization techniques.
- Developing skills in working with Jupyter Notebooks and pandas.

## License
This project is open-source. Feel free to modify and use the contents for your learning and analysis.
